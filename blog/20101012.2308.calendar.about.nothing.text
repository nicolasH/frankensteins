Calendar About Nothing

A while ago, there was a HN post about [Jerry Seinfeld's Productivity Secret](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1033433). In the comments, a few interesting links showed up, amongst which [calendar about nothing][can] which generates your streak (an unbroken sequence of days in which you attained some personnal objective) from your public (open source) github commits. 

When It was mentioned again a few month later in another HN post ([Ask HN: Share a gem. Teach me and you.](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1557119)) and I was already using github, I decided to give it a try. Long story short, my public output [dramatically increased][github_n] :

Obviously not all days are equally productive, but at least [every day][can_n] I move something forward, either some code or some content for this blog (as announced earlier, this blog's content is on [publicly available on github][github_nnmc]). One of the drawbacks is that on some days I do a commit, keep working and only commit these changes the next day. But on average, it is a net gain.
