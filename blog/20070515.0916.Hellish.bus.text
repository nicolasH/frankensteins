Hellish bus

I can't resist posting those two pictures of this bus number 666. Especialy since I registered Niconomicon.net on the 6th of june last year (6/6/6) ;) . This number is so popular nowadays : 97 M records on google.com, and 57 M on yahoo!. Susprisingly, there was only one google ad for this number, for a weird bible site. There was no ads for the 666 french *bande dessin&eacute;e*, or any music album.
