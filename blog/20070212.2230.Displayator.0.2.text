Displayator 0.2
Hello ! Introducing <a href="http://nikolas13.chez-alice.fr/displayator_0.2_20070211.zip">displayator 0.2</a>, now with some improved Readme!!!   
New feature :  you  can now move the displayed part of the picture from within the displayer. Just click some part and drag around. I also tweaked the way the tiles are exchanged from the provider to the displayer(s), but the result is only a slight improvement.   
   
That's it for now.
