Gigantic Panoramas

Crazy what you can do with patience and <a href="http://www.autostitch.net/">autostitch</a> ! Both picture here are made of 30 something picture. This are the "max flickr size" version so that flickr can do the thumbnails (max 15000px wide). I uploaded the originals too. They are 19800 and 22800 px wide, but have black thumbnails. Maybe someday I will dislplay them on a lot of screen using displayator.

Bugs met during making of those pictures : I was using the demo of autostitch and had to set the size of the generated panorama to be between 75 and 80% of the original. Otherwise I got some out of memory message. The memory option was set to the max possible(-1.5G) and I have 2G of memory installed.   
In flickr, picture with one dimension >= 15000px (or an uncompressed size >250MB) will not get miniaturized. Miniatures will be replaced by black placeholder. <a href="http://flickr.com/help/photos/#153">It seems to be a longstanding known bug</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/forums/bugs/12255/?search=black+thumbnails">I found a 18month old thread about that bug on their forum</a>.
