Winter is near !
I took <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nico_h/291799356/">a picture</a> this morning, while waiting for the work shuttle around 8 in the morning. Ice. On a bicycle seat. And all the other bikes were fancied up the same way. We are only starting November!  Autumn really is here. The cool and warm weather of last week was just a trick (13 / 24°C vs 4/12°C these days).   
The birds are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nico_h/291829641/"> gathering </a> and flying away. Well, maybe we'll get some snow early this year.   
   
Cheers.   
   
Nico, out.
