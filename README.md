## Readme for Frankenstein's 


The goal of this software is to generate a static html blog from
markdown compliant files. It is similar in goal to [jekyll][] and
[hyde][], but with a smaller scope and less elegance.

It is mostly UNIX based. The current version uses [multimarkdown from Fletcher Peney][mmd].

"His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as
beautiful. Beautiful!--Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the
work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous
black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these
luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,
that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in
which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black
lips." 
- Mary Shelley, 'Frankenstein'
